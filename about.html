            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I'm glad you're here! This page is my submission for CS50 pset8. It is the very first web page project of the course.
            Although I have some experience with web development I've decided to take CS50 to learn more about computer science.
            Learning C programming was a game changer for me. If you, like me, have learned an object oriented language without having any idea how does a low level language works,
            you probably never stop to think about what is happening when you call a method, for instance, '.sort' (as in Ruby). It seems like everything just works like magic right?
            Well, not in C. During the first weeks of the course we had to create almost everything from scratch, we had to think about scalability, space, time and so many things that never crossed my mind before.
            I'm so excited for the weeks to come, Python was the first programming language I ever had contact with but lately I've been using a lot of Ruby.
            Going back to Python and seeing everything with different eyes will surely be a great experience. Well, I hope you enjoy this page, below you'll find some random facts about me. Also, you can go to the Quote section
            for some inspiration (maybe some laughs). Feel free to get in touch, you can find my socials and email in this page's footer.</p>

                I collect plants! I've always loved plants and had killed a lot in the past specially when I was trying succulents.
                However during the pandemic it became an addiction and I grew my collection over 30+ plants including a few rare aroids.

                Yoga has changed my relationship with exercises. I like excercises and to work out in general but I wasn't aways like this.
                Starting a regular yoga practice made me realize how weak I was, couldn't do a single push up!
                I then went back to the gym willing to get stronger and nowadays I finally can say I enjoy it.

                Before software development I was a barista. I've worked with specialty coffee and really enjoy it.
                Coffee is a passion of mine and now a hobbie. I can do really nice latte art not gonna lie!
                But personally I'm not a latte person, nothing beats a good black V60 for me.

                Ok, I like cats, don't get me wrong. But I'm a dog person. I live in a tiny studio in London and unfortunatelly I can't have a dog.
                I often find myself watching puppies on youtube though.
